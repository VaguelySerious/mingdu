Be as concise and terse as possible, no platitudes. Treat me as an expert. After doing something, explain what you did extremely concisely.

This project is MingDu, a Mandarin tutor app, built using NextJS + ShadCN + Tailwind. Some old code left over from a previous working prototype is in `components/old-src`. To pull new ShadCN components, run `shadcn add <component>`.

Right now, we're at the start of the project, with only a basic chat interface defined, and in the process of proting the previous prototype to this project.

## MingDu Core functionality

- Chat interface with an LLM that acts as a language tutor, conversations stored in localStorage
- LLM calls return text chunked by words, and the app does a local dictionary lookup for every word to provide dictionary definitions on hover
- Local storage tracking of how often any word appeared on screen (counted first time it is returned by LLM and stored) (TODO)
- Local storage tracking of how often any word was used in writing by user (counted when user message submitted) (TODO)
- Coloring of words based on mastery (mix of appearance count + use count) (TODO)
- Correction prompts give context of past conversations to be more accurate
- User may ask the tutor about anything or direct as wished, otherwise tutor will default to asking the user about their day, etc. (TODO)
- For every user message, two AI API requests are made in parallel:
  - One conversing with the user like a friend, ignoring the user's mistakes and not acting as a tutor, unless the user asks specific questions about language use
  - One correcting the user's language use to be more natural, responding in pairs of quotes of the user's writing and a revised version which uses correct grammar (TODO)
  - Grammar corrections are displayed in a second line under the user's writing, only for the applicable snippets (TODO)

## Features

- Conversation history in sidebar

## Dictionaries & Data sources

For dictionaries, see (see `public/data/`). There's a Cedict copy (`cedict_ts.u8`) for dictionary entries, a `cedict.idx` file for lookups of character/word to line index of cedict, a list of common grammar-relevant words in `grammarKeywords.txt` that are can be used to index `https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/<word>`.
